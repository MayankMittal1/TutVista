# TutVista
As we know the global pandemic has led us to a  new ‘normal’ life.
The life which we expected to be around two-three decades the later-the online world has arrived at a very unexpected time when our
system has just begun to climb the ladder of development towards online education due to which many students have missed out on their
class interactions as they were never ready for this transition. We HyperText Assassins have come up with an idea of providing aid
during this time to those students who feel left out and are not able to interact with their teachers and are not able to clarify
their doubts leading their learning stunted.
TutVista provides a free platform to students of class 9-12 to ask their doubts,
both of school level and competitive exams like JEE and NEET so that they might have a confident approach towards their academics
and can grasp the concepts whose doubts they couldn’t ask in their online class. We will have an engaged community of student-tutor
and a fairly adaptable interface so that the doubt solving interaction can be quite feasible for every student.

Our team has deployed the project on url tutvista.herokuapp.com
